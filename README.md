# OIBSIP - Oasis Infobyte Intern Program

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Intern Program! During this internship, I undertook three tasks to enhance my skills in web development and design. Below are the details of each task along with links to the live projects:

## Task 1 - Calculator

For the first task, I created a functional calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface.



## Task 2 - Tribute Page

The second task involved designing and developing a tribute page. I chose to pay homage to [insert name/entity]. The tribute page creatively incorporates relevant images, text, and multimedia elements to honor [insert name/entity].



## Task 3 - Todo Web App

For the final task, I created a TO-DO web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. The application is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.



I approached each task with creativity and attention to detail, aiming to deliver high-quality work. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of the Oasis Infobyte Intern Program and look forward to further enhancing my skills in web development and design.

Thank you for your support and guidance throughout this internship!
